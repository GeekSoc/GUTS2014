Geeksoc's attempt at the Kana Challenge.

Excluding the unrare bug, this software will be

excellent-ish.

Kana inspired us to create interesting

software that is not

only playable, but useful, too! A

caffeine-fueled platform.


With a team of five of

incredible hunger, it is

nearly a miracle that we dodged

sleep, starvation and (in)sanity.
